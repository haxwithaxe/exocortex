This is a catch-all directory for a project I'm calling Exocortex - a system
that spiders and indexes arbitrary data sources (Twitter timelines, RSS feeds,
and other online storehouses of personally interesting and useful information)
and makes it possible to search and extract information from them as needed.
This project is likely to be in alpha for a long time because it scratches
a couple of personal itches.
